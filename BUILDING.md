1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. In a shell, `cd` to the unzipped archive
3. `npm install` (this will take a while, as it has to download Electron, which is ~100MB)
4. `npm start`
5. Sign into SE in the window that pops up
6. Due to a bug, probably in SE code, you’ll end up at stackexchange.com. It’s easiest to quit the app and start it again with `npm start` to end up at Charcoal.
7. Enjoy!
