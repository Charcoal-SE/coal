1. Install [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. In a shell, clone this repo or download the tar or zip.
3. `cd` to the cloned repo or unzipped archive
4. `npm install` (this will take a while, as it has to download Electron, which is ~100MB)
5. `npm start`
6. Sign into SE in the window that pops up
7. Due to a bug, probably in SE code, you’ll end up at stackexchange.com. It’s easiest to quit the app and start it again with `npm start` to end up at Charcoal.
8. Enjoy!

Some features don’t have a UI yet. In the console (open it with Ctrl+Shift+I or Cmd+Opt+I), you’ll see instructions for using these.
